# SRF-2018-Code

This code is a summary of the data collected by Gabriel Rossi, Weston Slaughter, Kobie Boslough, Shelley Pneh, and Keane Flynn during the summer of 2018 of the Porter Creek BACI study conducted in Sebastapol, CA. We hope to show the multifaceted effects on the aquatic food web in low flow in Mediterranean Streams and how stream augmentation implementation can counteract the harmful biotic and abiotic conditions the affected species face.
