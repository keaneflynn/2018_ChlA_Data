Confidence in stage data: Good.,,,,

"Confidence in streamflow data:  High during the field measurement season, February 2018 to October 2018; fair during the off season, November 2017 to January 2018. High for flows up to 10 ft3/sec; good for flows up to 75 ft3/sec; and fair for flows above 75 ft3/sec. Measured flow is consistently close to predicted flow during the field measurement season. Flow records above 75 ft3/s were estimated based on rating curve extension that included peak flow values scaled from the USGS Austin Creek gage (USGS gage 11467200, Austin Creek near Cazadero CA). Due to frequent changes to the channel bed, the relationship between stage and discharge may not be the same through the entire study period.",,,,

"The data reported here are preliminary and may be unreliable for reasons including, but not limited to, instrument malfunction, undetected disruptions or interference occurring at the measurement site, or errors in interpretation. Please note that temperature data have not been reviewed or calibrated, instruments may be located above the water levels in pools, and some instruments measure stage up to a certain height and will display a flat line at zero or the maximum height once that maximum measurable stage is reached.",,,,
